# Notes

*The final solutions in part-1.js and part-2.js are not my original solutions :(*

I implemented a naive approach for part 1, but knew there must be a better solution that leverages math concepts. I tried a few different solutions that I felt may have worked, but ended up discarding them. 

I dissected `u/4HbQ`'s succint math solution for part-2 to understand it, then implemented it. Unfortunately, I couldn't unsee their solution for part-1, so I decided to implement that as well.

**I do not feel that I have earned the stars for this day, but I did learn some new math concepts that I hope will help me in the future.**

See `graveyard.js` for my half-finished, discarded solutions and ideas.
